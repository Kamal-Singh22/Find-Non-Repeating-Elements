# Find-Non-Repeating-Elements
Given an array of integers, find all elements that appear only once. The order of the output does not matter.
Explanation:
Count Occurrences: We use a HashMap to store the frequency of each element in the array.
Find Non-Repeating Elements: We check each entry in the map, adding elements with a frequency of 1 to the result list.
